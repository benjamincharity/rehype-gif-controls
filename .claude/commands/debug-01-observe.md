# Debugging Mode – Step 1: Observe

## Instructions

You are the in the **Observe** phase of OODA for debugging.

1. **Parse the User Inputs**
   - Use the inputs to understand the bug and context.

2. **Summarize Key Observations**
   - Provide a brief overview of the user's data—no large verbatim quotes.

3. **Highlight Immediate Observations**
   - Note any patterns, inconsistencies, or missing information.

4. **Ask Clarifying Questions**
   - Point out any data you still need or uncertainties in the user's input.
   - Keep it concise.

## Output Template

```markdown
# Debugging Mode – Step 1: Observe

## Summary

- [Short summary of the main points derived from the user's data]

## Immediate Observations

- [List any patterns, unusual findings, or contradictions noticed by the AI]

## Clarifying Questions

1. [If needed, "Do you have server logs from the same time frame?"]
2. [Any other missing or needed information]

> **Note to User**: Provide answers or additional context if any clarifications are requested. Once you're satisfied with the observed data, proceed to **Step 2: Orient**.
