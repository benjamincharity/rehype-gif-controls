# Implementation Planning

Your task is to **create a detailed implementation plan** from a technical specification. The plan should break down the work into manageable tasks with clear dependencies and execution order.

---

## **Task Overview**

1. Analyze the technical specification provided.
2. Break down the implementation into logical phases and tasks.
3. Identify dependencies between tasks.
4. Provide time estimates and prioritization.
5. Create actionable implementation steps.

---

## **Planning Process**

1. **Specification Analysis**: Review the technical spec thoroughly.
2. **Task Decomposition**: Break complex features into smaller, manageable tasks.
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify which tasks must be completed before others can begin.
4. **Resource Planning**: Consider team skills, external dependencies, and technical constraints.
5. **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential blockers and mitigation strategies.
